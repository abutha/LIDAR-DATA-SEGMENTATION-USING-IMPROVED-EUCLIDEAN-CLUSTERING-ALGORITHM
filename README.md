# LIDAR-DATA-SEGMENTATION-USING-IMPROVED-EUCLIDEAN-CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM

Segmentation of Lidar Data is an essential part of automatic tasks, such as object detection.
The segmentation results pose a direct impact on the further processing.
This project focuses on enhancing object detection capabilities in autonomous systems
through improved Euclidean clustering. The methodology involves VoxelGrid filtering of
point cloud data to remove noise and unwanted points followed by the application of a
RANSAC ground segmentation algorithm to remove ground points and isolate non-ground
points. Subsequently, Euclidean clustering is employed to segment the point cloud data
into distinct object clusters. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, our project
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the accuracy of point
cloud segmentation and detecting objects. The results exhibit promising performance metrics,
highlighting the potential of our methodology for real-world applications such as autonomous
driving, surveillance, and urban planning.
This work also highlights the implementation using PYNQ-Z2
FPGA.
